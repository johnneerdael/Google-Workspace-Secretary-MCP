## Quick Start

Install via Docker (recommended):

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  workspace-secretary:
    image: ghcr.io/johnneerdael/google-workspace-secretary-mcp:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config  # Contains config.yaml and email_cache.db
    environment:
      - WORKSPACE_TIMEZONE=America/Los_Angeles
    restart: always
```

**Important**: Generate a unique bearer token for security:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
uuidgen

# Windows PowerShell
[guid]::NewGuid().ToString()
```

Add to your `config/config.yaml`:

```yaml
bearer_auth:
  enabled: true
  token: "your-generated-uuid-here"
```

Then start with: `docker-compose up -d`

See [Getting Started](/getting-started) for complete installation instructions.

## Why Google Workspace Secretary MCP?

Traditional email clients are built for humans. **Google Workspace Secretary MCP** is built for AI assistants.

- **Instant reads**: SQLite cache means sub-millisecond email queries (v2.0)
- **Token-efficient**: Bulk email fetching with smart truncation (700 chars) for fast triage
- **Context-rich**: Full thread history, attachment content, and calendar context in one tool call
- **Intelligence signals**: VIP detection, urgency markers, question detection—not hardcoded decisions
- **Agentic workflows**: Compose specialized agents (Triage, Scheduler, Intelligence Clerk) using atomic tools

## Example Workflows

::: tip Daily Briefing
"Give me my daily briefing—what emails need my attention today?"

The AI uses `get_daily_briefing()` to fetch:
- Today's calendar events
- Email candidates with 5 priority signals (VIP, urgent, questions, deadlines, meetings)
- Intelligent summary prioritizing your VIP senders and time-sensitive requests
:::

::: tip Smart Scheduling
"I received a meeting invite from John for tomorrow at 2 PM. Check my calendar and if I'm free during working hours, draft an acceptance."

The AI:
1. Checks calendar availability with `check_calendar()`
2. Validates time is within your `working_hours`
3. Uses `create_draft_reply()` to prepare response
4. Shows you the draft for confirmation
:::

::: tip Document Intelligence
"Find the invoice PDF sent by Accounting last week, read it, and tell me the total amount."

The AI:
1. Searches with `search_emails(keyword='invoice', from='accounting')`
2. Extracts PDF text with `get_attachment_content()`
3. Parses and presents the total
:::

## What's New in v2.0.0

**Local-First Architecture** — The server now operates like a proper email client (Thunderbird, Apple Mail):

- ⚡ **SQLite Cache**: Email queries hit local database instead of IMAP—instant response times
- 🔄 **Background Sync**: Continuous incremental sync keeps your cache fresh (every 5 minutes)
- 💾 **Persistent Storage**: Cache survives restarts; only fetches new emails after initial sync
- 📊 **RFC-Compliant**: Proper UIDVALIDITY/UIDNEXT tracking per RFC 3501/4549

See the [Architecture Documentation](/architecture) for technical details.

## What's New in v1.1.0

- ✅ **Dual OAuth Mode** - `oauth_mode: api` (Gmail REST) or `oauth_mode: imap` (IMAP/SMTP)
- ✅ **Third-party OAuth Support** - Use Thunderbird/GNOME credentials with `imap` mode
- ✅ **SMTP with XOAUTH2** - Send emails via authenticated SMTP in IMAP mode
- ✅ **Calendar works in both modes** - Google Calendar API is independent of email backend

## What's New in v0.2.0

- ✅ **Timezone-aware scheduling** - All calendar operations use your configured timezone
- ✅ **Working hours constraints** - Meeting suggestions respect your work schedule
- ✅ **Intelligent email signals** - 5 ML-ready signals for AI-driven prioritization
- ✅ **VIP sender detection** - Configurable list of priority email addresses

[See Migration Guide](/guide/configuration#migration-from-v01x) for upgrading from earlier versions.
